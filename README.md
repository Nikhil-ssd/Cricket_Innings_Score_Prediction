### Purpose of solving the problem

Predicting the runs scored by a team at any point during an innings in cricket can serve multiple practical and strategic purposes. Here’s a breakdown of potential use cases:

#### 1. Enhanced Match Analysis and Strategy:
Real-time Decision Making: Teams can use the predicted score to decide their approach (e.g., whether to accelerate or consolidate).
Bowling Strategy: Bowling teams can adapt their plans (e.g., setting up field placements or choosing bowlers) based on predicted outcomes.

#### 2. Broadcasting and Fan Engagement:
Predictive Analytics for Viewers: Broadcasters can use the model to display real-time predictions during matches, making the game more engaging for fans.
Interactive Features: Platforms can introduce features like "guess the score" or predictions based on the ML model for fan participation.

#### 3. Team Performance Optimization:
Post-Match Review: Teams can analyze discrepancies between predicted and actual scores to identify key moments where performance fell below expectations.
Player Performance Insights: Insights into how specific players contribute to score predictions, helping coaches focus on key areas of improvement.

#### 4. Betting and Fantasy Cricket:
Betting Odds: Helps bookmakers offer dynamic odds based on predicted scores.
Fantasy League Support: Assists fantasy players in making informed decisions about which players to choose or strategies to adopt.

#### 5. Statistical Insights and Research:
Game Insights: Helps statisticians study patterns like impact of wickets, batting partnerships, or pitch conditions on scoring rates.
Comparative Analysis: Enables comparison of team or player performance across matches, conditions, or opponents.

#### 6. Data-Driven Decision Support in Tournaments:
Resource Allocation: Teams can plan batting lineups or rest key players in less-critical matches using insights from predictive models.
Tournament Strategy: Helps teams understand the target scores needed to optimize Net Run Rate (NRR) in tournaments.

#### 7. Game Simulations:
What-If Scenarios: Teams or analysts can simulate various scenarios (e.g., early wickets, higher scoring rates) to predict outcomes and plan strategies accordingly.

#### 8. Business and Sponsorships:
Commercial Use: Sponsors or advertisers can use score predictions to tailor real-time advertisements based on the game’s context.
Fantasy Gaming Revenue: Models can enhance the realism and appeal of cricket-based fantasy games or apps.

By applying machine learning to predict scores, stakeholders in cricket—from players and teams to broadcasters and fans—can gain a deeper understanding of the game and leverage data-driven insights for better decision-making and enhanced experiences.
